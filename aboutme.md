# About me

I'm a MSc student at Eindhoven Technical University (TU/e) majoring in [Data Science in Engineering](https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/graduate-school/masters-programs/computer-science-and-engineering/). I am currently doing my master thesis at [DAF Trucks](https://www.daf.com/en/sites-landing) under the supervision of [Marwan Hassani](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mhassani/).

# Background

I did my bachelor in Computer Engineering at Madrid Technical University (UPM). During my bachelor I worked as an intern at the [Distributed Systems Laboratory](http://lsd.ls.fi.upm.es/) and after graduating, I kept working as a full-time researcher. You can find more about my background [here](https://casamatechs.github.io/files/CV_Carlos.pdf).
